    title: "Apple accidentally confirms ‘realityOS’ for its AR/VR headset",
    category: "Technology",
    img: "./images/technology.jpg",
    desc: `The company is said to have been working on an AR/VR headset for many years. The headset is said to offer an innovative experience with “seamless” switching between AR and VR modes.

      All the way back in 2017, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported that Apple was ramping up work on an AR headset “to succeed iPhone”. In his report, Gurman said the new OS for the device was internally dubbed “rOS” for “reality operating system” and is based on iOS.
      
      In an interview with The Independent around the same time, Apple CEO Tim Cook said of such a headset: “Anything you would see on the market any time soon would not be something any of us would be satisfied with.”
      
      Time has validated Cook’s view, with AR headsets over the past few years offering a lacklustre experience at best. However, the rumour mill suggests Apple believes it’s almost ready to deliver a product that customers will be satisfied with.
      
      The pieces feel like they’re aligning for Apple.
      
      While struggling with the same component shortages as the rest of the industry, the company’s in-house silicon efforts have been widely-praised for offering fantastic performance and low battery consumption in compact forms—exactly what you want powering an AR headset.
      
      Renowned analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claims Apple’s headset will “adopt two CPUs made of 4nm and 5nm” and require the same 96W charger used for the 14-inch MacBook Pro. The charger is expected to be supplied by Jabil.
      
      Kuo says the 96W charger requirement “proves that Apple AR/MR requires the same level of computing power as the MacBook Pro and is significantly higher than the iPhone.”
      
      Developers have also had access to ARKit since 2017 to start building augmented reality apps for Apple’s ecosystem. In 2020, LiDAR debuted on the ‘Pro’ versions of the iPhone and iPad to further boost the development of AR apps. While there’s yet to be many wildly successful AR apps, there’s a healthy base for Apple to launch a headset with that few platforms could replicate.
      
      Last month, Kuo said that Apple can afford to wait as the headset “is about 2-3 years ahead of competitors’ products.”
      
      However, pending any further supply chain issues, it seems that consumers won’t need to wait too long. Kuo believes Apple’s headset will launch in Q4 2022 in limited quantities with shipments ramping up in Q1 2023.`,

      "State of Software Security v12: Don’t become complacent, but we’ve come a long way",

    img: "./images/technology-3.jpg",
    desc: `Veracode’s latest State of Software Security report highlights that applications are, on average, more secure than ever.

      Getting the negatives out the way first, the report warns about the devastating “domino effect” that one vulnerability can have on software across the globe.
      
      One clear example of this in action was the SolarWinds attack in which hackers inserted malicious code into the company’s Orion software. Every company and organisation using Orion was left vulnerable—including Microsoft, Cisco, FireEye, Intel, NATO, the UK Government, European Parliament, and multiple US federal agencies.
      
      On 12 May 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order introducing new regulations to improve the nation’s cybersecurity.
      
      With the 12th edition of its annual report, Veracode set out to help leaders make informed decisions about how to improve their software security, minimise risk, and meet the new regulations. The result is 48 pages that are packed with useful insights.
      
      In this article, we’ll cover just some of the highlights from Veracode State of Software Security Volume 12.
      
      The software security landscape
      Veracode highlights an industry shift towards one-language apps or microservices. In 2018, around 20 percent of apps used multiple languages. In 2021, that number plummeted to less than 5 percent.
      
      Improved continuous testing practices have led to 90 percent of apps now being scanned more than once a week, with most being scanned three times per week. That’s a 20x increase from 2010 when apps were scanned just two or three times per year.`,

    category: "Travel",
    img: "./images/travel-1.jpg",
    desc: `There is a mountain in the Allgäu Alps that is probably the most ludicrous in all of Europe. It is called the Sorgschrofen, it is 1,636m high, and it is marked by a Gipfelkreuz, or summit cross, which stands above a sheer-sided cliff face of white-webbed rock.

      Formed from reef limestone, the knuckle looms above the triangle-shaped village of Jungholz in the western Tirol of Austria. While it pales in significance to other mightier Alpine peaks, it fires the mind of cartophiles for a wholly unusual reason.
      
      For the cross at its top – an almost abstract feature on any map – marks the only geographical point where the Tirolean village and the rest of Austria meet. And almost unbelievably, this strip of connecting land is less than 1m wide.
      
      No matter the absurdity, it is utterly necessary. Because Jungholz, population 302, is as Austrian as Vienna or Salzburg – yet it is surrounded by Germany on all sides, with no road connection to Austria. The only way Austrians in the exclave can reach their homeland is via Bavaria.
      
      Jungholz had never crossed my mind prior to this winter, and it is highly likely you have never heard of it either. Many Austrians are also unfamiliar with the mountain village; before making the trip, I asked locals in the Tirolean towns of Kitzbühel and Innsbruck what to expect and no one was any wiser than I. My interest in its incongruous geography deepened. `,

    category: "Travel",
    img: "./images/travel-2.jpg",
    desc: `March 2022 marks the 80th anniversary of the start of construction on the Alaska Highway. Considered one of the most scenic highways in Canada, the 1,387-mile highway attracts more than 300,000 road trippers from around the world every year.

      Beginning in Dawson Creek, British Columbia, and winding north-westerly 613 miles through BC into Yukon, and then another 577 miles to the US border, the road passes from the Rocky Mountains to subarctic alpine tundra to the jagged peaks of Kluane National Park and Reserve before ending at Delta Junction, Alaska. Along the route, parks, campsites, resorts and small towns welcome visitors while locals relish the opportunity to share stories about life in the northern frontier. Dawson Creek, a remote farming community located in the rolling foothills of the Northern Rockies near the Alberta border, might seem like an odd place for the start of an international highway. The town wasn't much more than a 600-person rail terminus when Canada and the US first began discussing plans to build a road connecting the lower 48 states with the far-flung northern outpost in 1929. Until 1930, Alaska was only accessible by boat from the contiguous US, and as US relations cooled with Japan, the isolated territory seemed especially at risk against a potential Japanese attack against the North American mainland, as Alaska's Aleutian Islands are just 750 miles from the closest Japanese military base. `,

    title: "Top 10 NFT Games to Earn",
    category: "Nft Art",
    img: "./images/nft-1.jpg",
    desc: `Since their introduction, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have proven their ability to transform the gaming industry. In recent days, nothing has been more entertaining than blockchain-based NFT games. NFTs are bringing out a new era where crypto-gaming enthusiasts are going crazy for these exciting games, especially since they come with increased profitability that allows you to trade your items and in-game characters with other players. The majority of free NFT games promise a triple-digit percentage or more return on investment (ROI).

      What are NFT Games?
      
      Video games are one of the markets where NFTs can play a role in driving growth, as they allow content developers to monetize their creations, while players can earn cryptocurrencies by engaging with the content.
      
      In videos games, NFTs are used to create characters, avatars, and items that players can collect to facilitate their play and trade with other players. The value of an item depends on its use and rarity. Developers set up smart contracts that define how NFTs work in the game. The contracts are stored on the blockchain. In-game assets are traded as if they were physical assets.  One of the first games with NFT characters was CryptoKitties, which launched in 2017 on the Ethereum blockchain. In CryptoKitties, players collect, breed, and trade digital cats. Each cat is a unique NFT. Smart contracts define their characteristics and scarcity, which in turn determine their value on a given NFT marketplace, such as AirNFTs. 
      
      Some Play-to-Earn NFT games are designed as metaverses, in which players can receive rewards for playing the game and advancing their skills. The games reward players with cryptocurrency tokens, which they can use to buy NFTs.
      
      In this article, we present you the top 10 NFT games you should keep an eye on in 2022 according to DappRadar’s ranking. You will find some free-to-play NFT games, play-to-earn NFT games, and other blockchain games. `,

      "Microsoft sets out to woo regulators with ‘Open App Store Principles’",
    category: "Technology",
    img: "./images/technology-2.jpg",
    desc: `Microsoft is getting ahead of potential new laws governing app stores by announcing its Open App Store Principles.
  
        Last week, Developer reported on Apple’s latest fight against such legislation after the company sent a letter to US lawmakers urging them to reject S. 2710—a bill that would force Apple to open its notorious “walled garden” and enable the sideloading of apps.
        
        Microsoft has managed to avoid being the focus of high-profile antitrust investigations in recent years (after facing its fair share at the height of Windows’ success). Instead, global regulators have targeted the arguably monopolistic ecosystems of Apple and Google.
        
        The only software platform owned by Microsoft today that could face similar investigations as those of Apple and Google is Xbox.
        
        Xbox recently announced its intention to purchase Activision Blizzard and all of its subsidiaries in a blockbuster deal valued at $68.7 billion. Microsoft is upfront in preparing for regulatory scrutiny over the deal and hopes its Open App Store Principles will help to allay their fears.
        
        Brad Smith, Microsoft President and Vice Chair, wrote in a blog post:
        
        “Today, we’re announcing a new set of Open App Store Principles that will apply to the Microsoft Store on Windows and to the next-generation marketplaces we will build for games.
        
        We have developed these principles in part to address Microsoft’s growing role and responsibility as we start the process of seeking regulatory approval in capitals around the world for our acquisition of Activision Blizzard.
        
        This regulatory process begins while many governments are also moving forward with new laws to promote competition in app markets and beyond. We want regulators and the public to know that as a company, Microsoft is committed to adapting to these new laws, and with these principles, we’re moving to do so.”
        
        There are four key areas that make up the Open App Store Principles:
        Developer Choice – Microsoft will put control in developers’ hands. Developers will be free to use alternative payment systems, won’t be required to give Microsoft’s app store more favourable terms, or be prevented from communicating with their customers for legitimate purposes.  `,

    title: "Art using NFTs, here to stay?",
    category: "Nft Art",
    img: "./images/nft-3.jpg",
    desc: `From Impressionism to “NFT Art”
      From impressionism to this present moment of NFT Art, critics of innovation in Art have followed a fairly standard script. The critic expresses how fed up he is (it is usually a “he”) with what has accosted his eyes. He then characterizes the Art as devoid of meaning, confused or unfinished. As a result of these characterizations, the critic avoids conducting any actual analysis, including consideration of the context that produced the work, and leans into attacking the Artist.
      
      It was often not enough to simply dislike the Art work, but innovative Art had to be the product of “diseased minds.” Early Impressionist and Cubist Artists heard this attack and variations on it frequently. Denouncing Art as the product of illness or “otherness” came with a subtle implication, one that applies equally to NFT Art.
      
      During the 19th and early 20th Centuries, the eras when Impressionism and Cubism began, respectively, an unwell person or outsider would have been deemed unworthy of an apprenticeship with an established Artist. Too much risk, too little reward. What would the patrons say? A would-be Artist without a master was not an Artist at all and could not hope to be. 
      
      NFTs don’t need gatekeepers to exist
      In the 21st century, outsiders like trans teenage NFT Artist Victor Langois are on the receiving end of similar doubt and derision. He skipped the gatekeeping with the goal of directly reaching his audience thanks to the distributed nature of the NFT medium. 
      
      Like NFT Artists of the 21st century, prior Artistic innovators looked towards non-traditional subject matter. In 1863, Impressionist Artists who had been denied participation in the Salon of Paris, formed their own Salon des Refusés where they could display work in unconventional styles about unconventional topics. Remember that famous painting of well-dressed men having a picnic with nude women (LINK 2)? That was displayed at the Salon des Refuses. 
      
      About fifty years later, Picasso looked to African Art he encountered at a French Ethnographic Museum as a primary source of inspiration for his early Cubist works. That is, he did not look to the old masters, and this is the crux of why people criticize NFT Art: there is no guru, master or teacher.
      
      There is no approved, “proper” range of subject matter. There is no school diploma that states “Master of Fine Art.” The Artist’s apprenticeship is their own, as trans teen NFT Artist Victor Langois has proved (LINK 2), and so is the Art. The artist can study where they want, how they want and distribute their Art in an equally decentralized manner. 
      
      The pupil is already the master, thank you very much.   `,
